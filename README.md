## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass using SCSS syntax
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

By building this project I practiced my JavaScript and CSS skills, in case of CSS it was using SASS and CSS Grid and Flexbox. In case of JavaScript it was DOM manipulaton.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to learn more advanced properties of CSS Grid and get more comfortable using it where it's more appropriate.
